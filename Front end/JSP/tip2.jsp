    <h1>Exam Preparation Tips</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start Early:</strong> Begin your study sessions well in advance of the exam date. This will help you avoid last-minute cramming and reduce stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Make a Schedule:</strong> Create a study schedule that outlines what topics you will study and when. Stick to this schedule to ensure you cover all material.</li>
        <li><strong>Take Breaks:</strong> Don’t study for long periods without breaks. Short breaks can help you stay focused and retain information better.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Past Papers:</strong> Reviewing past exam papers can give you a good idea of the format and types of questions that may be asked.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Healthy:</strong> Get enough sleep, eat healthy foods, and exercise regularly. A healthy body contributes to a healthy mind.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Positive:</strong> Keep a positive attitude and believe in your ability to succeed. Confidence can greatly impact your performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek Help:</strong> If you’re struggling with a topic, don’t hesitate to ask for help from teachers, friends, or tutors.</li>
    </ul>
